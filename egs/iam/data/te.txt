d01-098-00 The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
d01-098-01 and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made
d01-098-02 a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number
d01-098-03 which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
d01-098-04 this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It
d01-098-05 was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not
d01-098-06 an easy form of book in which to find a
d01-104-00 This last objection might have had some weight in
d01-104-01 ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,
d01-104-02 the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
d01-104-03 As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01-104-04 overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his
d01-104-05 information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
d01-104-06 The other form of book was the codex . In this the
d01-104-07 sheets were bound together down one edge much as
d04-012-00 The word Shamir was used as a
d04-012-01 personal name ( Git. 68a ) . The Hebrew
d04-012-02 word " SHAMIR " means guarded or preser-
d04-012-03 ved . Therefore , the real man , who
d04-012-04 regards himself as insignificant , as the
d04-012-05 prayer says : " What am I ? A worm " , he
d04-012-06 is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
d04-012-07 the Shmah , loves the Lord God with
d04-012-08 all his heart , and with all his soul and
d04-012-09 with all his might and studies the
d04-016-00 This man is the worm , the creature that
d04-016-01 cuts and polishes Altar-Stones . Such
d04-016-02 a man is the Shamir that guards him-
d04-016-03 self against all the irrelevant pleasures .
d04-016-04 Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
d04-016-05 to mould our character , to melt our
d04-016-06 heart of stone . This Shamir helps
d04-016-07 us earthly creatures to build an Altar
d04-016-08 for God to come nearer to God .
d04-021-00 The action of the Shamir writes books and their
d04-021-01 books are readable . This Shamir is indeed a rare
d04-021-02 diamond that incises the hardest rock , the hardest
d04-021-03 facts . And these creatures existed from the
d04-021-04 beginning . It is " the stone , which the builders
d04-021-05 refused , but it is to become the head-stone
d04-021-06 of the corner " . ( Ps. 118 , 22 . ) And the stone shall
d04-028-00 " For the stone shall cry out of the wall " , like
d04-028-01 Baalam's ass , " and the purlin of timber shall
d04-028-02 creak in answer " " if the roof of our security is
d04-028-03 crushing our soul " ( see Hab. 2 , 10-11 ) . And it is
d04-028-04 through the Shamir : " That the earth shall be
d04-028-05 filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
d04-028-06 Lord , as the waters cover the sea . " ( Hab. 2 , 14 . )
d04-050-00 They will not work in union . If physical power , spiritual power
d04-050-01 and visionary power is not united , man will remain in his heart
d04-050-02 selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
d04-050-03 gratify selfish aims , then each man will gather-in
d04-050-04 for himself only , instead of all to help to gather your
d05-008-00 The new century opened with James 1 ascending
d05-008-01 the throne . He was quite prepared to be
d05-008-02 tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
d05-008-03 spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for
d05-008-04 James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,
d05-008-05 but those hopes were dashed . True , a new Prayer
d05-008-06 Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
d05-008-07 derived little comfort from it .
d05-021-00 This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
d05-021-01 been the mood which produced the Black Rubric , for
d05-021-02 it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ , which are
d05-021-03 verily and indeed taken and received by the
d05-021-04 faithful in the Lord's Supper . ' It could hardly be more
d05-021-05 definite . It was at this time , too , that King James made
d05-021-06 himself immortal by becoming associated with
d05-021-07 a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
d05-021-08 ( which was never actually authorized ! ) .
d05-025-00 In that year Shakespeare had just turned
d05-025-01 forty and had written Hamlet two years
d05-025-02 before . Bacon was at work and Milton was
d05-025-03 just learning to read . James was followed by
d05-025-04 Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish
d05-025-05 Prayer Book in 1637 . Significantly this made
d05-025-06 a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
d05-025-07 became the foster mother of some of the most
d05-025-08 important Prayer Books in the Anglican
d05-030-00 Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,
d05-030-01 now so much nobler a figure than former historians
d05-030-02 led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated
d05-030-03 by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was
d05-030-04 mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his
d05-030-05 first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
d05-030-06 the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly
d05-030-07 with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,
d05-030-08 was necessarily a menace .
d06-037-00 To others , the long hours of the night bring
d06-037-01 only a disturbed tossing and turning
d06-037-02 which causes them to wake feeling worse
d06-037-03 than when they went to bed . We may begin
d06-037-04 to understand this a little better when we
d06-037-05 realize that tiredness itself is largely in
d06-037-06 the mind . Very few people , under normal
d06-037-07 conditions , work themselves to a standstill .
d06-041-00 The mind tires first and conveys the impression
d06-041-01 of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by
d06-041-02 noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
d06-041-03 body who feels thoroughly tired . Suppose
d06-041-04 a mother has news late at night that her
d06-041-05 child is in danger . She will undertake a
d06-041-06 journey which , an hour before , she would
d06-041-07 have declared impossible .
d06-060-00 One of the greatest steps forward that has been
d06-060-01 made this century is the way in which illness
d06-060-02 of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,
d06-060-03 and is in fact no differently regarded than
d06-060-04 physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a
d06-060-05 great deal of tiredness which comes from
d06-060-06 no major complication but results from an
d06-060-07 inability to deal with life , especially under
d06-060-08 the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
d06-072-00 In many cases , their homes know little of
d06-072-01 their place of work and their associates at
d06-072-02 the office or works wonder what they
d06-072-03 are possibly like in the surroundings of their
d06-072-04 homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead
d06-072-05 a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
d06-072-06 planning to do so or in fact being conscious
d06-072-07 of what is going on . It is easier to live life in
d06-072-08 compartments but over the years it builds up ,
d06-072-09 and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
d06-072-10 need to be handled correctly .
d06-086-00 The housewife would find life far less tiring
d06-086-01 if she made a list , followed a routine of work
d06-086-02 rather than getting from one thing to the next .
d06-086-03 The business man would find that he reached
d06-086-04 the end of the day with far less strain if
d06-086-05 he was a little more systematic . To drift
d06-086-06 aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
d06-086-07 thing else . If we would only sit down and
d06-086-08 write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
d06-086-09 be done and then work quietly through them ,
d06-086-10 we would find life considerably less exhausting
d06-100-00 As it is , with so much of our life already
d06-100-01 in a predetermined groove , I would
d06-100-02 hardly like to add further to the dullness
d06-100-03 which it engenders . But I am not arguing
d06-100-04 for this . I know how much of a drag it can be
d06-100-05 and I was interested some little while
d06-100-06 ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
d06-113-00 She will , in fact , be surprised at what peace
d06-113-01 of mind ensues . ( b ) Concentrate on one
d06-113-02 thing at a time . A list or a plan enables us to
d06-113-03 put all our energies into the particular
d07-082-00 ( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof
d07-082-01 texts and the Gemara explains why these ,
d07-082-02 too , are necessary , but a careful examination
d07-082-03 of that passage makes it clear that these are
d07-082-04 not quoted here because they are not
d07-082-05 necessary to prove the point made by
d07-082-06 R. Joshua b. Levi . ) Finally , we note that
d07-082-07 the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
d07-085-00 From the above it follows that here , once again ,
d07-085-01 we have a good illustration of how a
d07-085-02 sugya has been fashioned from material
d07-085-03 already in the hands of the Redactors .
d07-085-04 The sugya is built around the saying of
d07-085-05 R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the
d07-085-06 reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
d07-085-07 with the comment given by Samuel .
d07-089-00 ( This is probably to be understood as a well-
d07-089-01 known comment on the verse ; quoted by
d07-089-02 Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
d07-089-03 by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
d07-089-04 Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by
d07-089-05 the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah .
d07-089-06 There is no reference to the Mishnah here
d07-089-07 because the Mishnah deals with the
d07-089-08 actual practice of greeting by the divine
d07-089-09 Name and the Gemara here quotes the
d07-089-10 texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi .
d07-093-00 The question and answer with regard to the
d07-093-01 need for the text of the angel are quoted
d07-093-02 here in the same words in which they are
d07-093-03 quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
d07-093-04 This can either mean that both sugyas are
d07-093-05 quoting a well-known question and
d07-093-06 answer or that our sugya is quoting from
d07-093-07 the longer sugya which deals with all
d07-093-08 four texts quoted in the Mishnah .
d07-096-00 Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
d07-096-01 original question and answer and this is quoted
d07-096-02 in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the
d07-096-03 use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own
d07-096-04 accord but there was no approval of his action
d07-096-05 in Heaven ' in both sugyoth . Such an
d07-096-06 expression appears to have been framed in
d07-096-07 response to the particular point at issue here ,
d07-096-08 whether the Heavenly Court concurred
d07-096-09 in the decision of the human court . )
d07-100-00 The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
d07-100-01 is then quoted and the interpretation of the
d07-100-02 latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
d07-100-03 is added , not because this is at all relevant
d07-100-04 to the discussion but because it was
d07-100-05 a familiar interpretation which had
d07-100-06 become so well known that it was
d07-100-07 invariably quoted whenever the verse
d07-100-08 itself was quoted , almost as if it were a
d07-102-00 The Gemara continues with a saying of the
d07-102-01 Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) :
d07-102-02 ' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places :
d07-102-03 the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah ,
d07-102-04 and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this
d07-102-05 saying here is obvious , it follows naturally
d07-102-06 on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
d07-102-07 deals with a similar theme .
e06-033-00 Herring fishermen call this " the outset " . It
e06-033-01 is strongest at spring tides , when without
e06-033-02 wind you will " set " out - or drift to the east-
e06-033-03 ward , the length of half a fleet of nets -
e06-033-04 almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
e06-033-05 Knoll . Without an explanation of how it
e06-033-06 works , it may well be that this outset , akin
e06-033-07 to the mouth of a great salmon river , has
e06-033-08 been the biggest factor through the ages
e06-033-09 in the constancy of this great herring fishery .
e06-053-00 Then they stop swimming and are caught . In
e06-053-01 the seine-net film this usually seemed to
e06-053-02 happen just after the fish had risen above
e06-053-03 the footrope , and presumably out of its
e06-053-04 field of disturbance , or bow wave . This suggests
e06-053-05 that the wave might be transmitted by the
e06-053-06 sea-bed , though the footrope in this case
e06-053-07 was actually just off the bottom and was
e06-053-08 indeed passing over some fish .
e06-070-00 Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
e06-070-01 And in this film the rise of the fish was
e06-070-02 small , a matter of a foot or two . With round
e06-070-03 fish like haddock , which would hardly
e06-070-04 find safety on the bottom , this cover
e06-070-05 would seem to be even more essential ;
e06-070-06 but more films are needed to prove this .
e06-070-07 Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
e06-070-08 essential to catch round fish whose
e06-070-09 reaction to disturbance would be upwards .
f04-039-00 This man agreed that his engagement had
f04-039-01 been broken off after one particular
f04-039-02 tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
f04-039-03 money . All the while the police were casting about
f04-039-04 for a man who had been seen leaving the train
f04-039-05 at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual
f04-039-06 as a man of about thirty , of medium height , with
f04-039-07 a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat
f04-043-00 The porter at the station bore out this
f04-043-01 description , but the man was not traced .
f04-043-02 Perhaps the news of their search got around ,
f04-043-03 for a man did obligingly present himself
f04-043-04 at Wandsworth police-station , claiming to have
f04-043-05 committed the murder - but he was mentally
f04-043-06 defective , and , despite his claim to infamy ,
f04-043-07 had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .
f04-053-00 And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with
f04-053-01 adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return
f04-053-02 a verdict of " wilful murder against some person or
f04-053-03 persons unknown . " The most vital clue of the Wedgwood
f04-053-04 pestle had been of no assistance . The killer must
f04-053-05 have been very thankful that the science of
f04-053-06 dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings .
f04-057-00 The next female fatality occurred eight years later ,
f04-057-01 yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
f04-057-02 a further seven years before even a ghost of a
f04-057-03 solution emerged . There has always been something
f04-057-04 sinister in the idea of tunnels . The building of
f04-057-05 them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
f04-057-06 nected with railway construction ; and there
f04-057-07 were many people who believed that to travel
f04-057-08 through tunnels would be an equally
f07-069-00 Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament
f07-069-01 than is customarily imagined as well as entering human
f07-069-02 activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed .
f07-069-03 We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
f07-069-04 one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
f07-069-05 which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years .
f07-069-06 If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red
f07-069-07 with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation ,
f07-069-08 Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which
f07-069-09 provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant
f07-073-00 The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener
f07-073-01 Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with
f07-073-02 aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious
f07-073-03 fire , aerian creams , ingenious pastries and a
f07-073-04 crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by a pastry cook to
f07-073-05 celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683 . Spanish
f07-073-06 cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights , of Spanish dancing
f07-073-07 and of Goja : it is vivid , highly coloured , sometimes
f07-073-08 Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour , with
f07-073-09 streaks of poetry , meat disguised under heavy and vehement
f07-081b-00 The French have an inborn appreciation of good food and
f07-081b-01 the gusto which they derive from gastronomy is intellectual
f07-081b-02 and aesthetic as well as physical . There is the same finesse
f07-081b-03 about their feeding , the same subtle delicacy of touch ,
f07-081b-04 the same unfailing sense of proportion as exists among
f07-081b-05 her writers , music composers and other exponents of
f07-081b-06 things that are typically French .
f07-084b-00 The " pot-au-feu " is as much a national institution
f07-084b-01 in France as is tea drinking among ourselves and it is
f07-084b-02 prepared at least once a week in every bourgeois
f07-084b-03 household . Thackeray , of course , waxed enthusiastic
f07-084b-04 about Bouillabaisse and sang - This Bouillabaisse a
f07-084b-05 noble dish is , A sort of soup , or broth , or brew ,
f07-084b-06 A hotch-potch of all sorts of fishes That Greenwich
f07-084b-07 never could outdo ; Green herbs , red peppers , mussels ,
f07-084b-08 saffron , Soles , onions , garlic , roach and dace .
g01-004-00 It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
g01-004-01 Londoners , but it brought heavy censure from nobles
g01-004-02 who still believed that they had a monopoly of
g01-004-03 leadership . But , at last , Gaunt sailed . Opposing
g01-004-04 him was the French Admiral , Jean de Vienne -
g01-004-05 a great sailor and an able strategist .
g01-008-00 Obedient to the policy of his King , de Vienne avoided
g01-008-01 trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
g01-008-02 on land . Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
g01-008-03 an elusive foe , and , afraid to return home without
g01-008-04 something to show , he foolishly attempted to besiege
g01-008-05 the well-protected fortress of St Malo . This
g01-008-06 involved the dreary method of mining operations in
g01-008-07 which Gaunt , under the Black Prince , had shown
g01-008-08 considerable skill at the siege of Limoges .
g01-025-00 In this cruel process which was
g01-025-01 hammering out nations on the anvils of
g01-025-02 war , there was a constant stirring of
g01-025-03 those in authority to find some simple
g01-025-04 way out of the complicated financial
g01-025-05 6impasse which always resulted , and in the
g01-025-06 story of the experiments and expedients
g01-025-07 to which the Exchequer resorted is
g01-025-08 the story of the prelude to the
g01-025-09 Peasants' Revolt of 1381 .
g01-027-00 In appreciating this story , modern con-
g01-027-01 ceptions of governmental duties must be
g01-027-02 set aside . A modern government needs
g01-027-03 taxation not merely for defence and
g01-027-04 offence but for a very wide range of
g01-027-05 social services . A mediaeval oligarchy
g01-027-06 needed taxation in order to supplement
g01-027-07 the private wealth of the monarchy
g01-027-08 ( the royal income from the revenues of
g01-027-09 crown lands , the fees of feudalism
g01-031-00 Social service as a function of government
g01-031-01 was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
g01-031-02 substitute was the mutual self-help of
g01-031-03 communities , whether those communities were
g01-031-04 monasteries , manors , townships , or wards and
g01-031-05 guilds of a city . A mediaeval tax was
g01-031-06 therefore in essence a forced payment whose
g01-031-07 return was the uncertain bounty of booty
g01-031-08 and the vague advantages of military glory ;
g01-031-09 it was therefore always granted grudgingly
g01-031-10 and coupled with the vain hope that , in the
g01-034-00 When ' his ' war did not bring victory and
g01-034-01 booty , a new group of Lords might oust
g01-034-02 the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons ,
g01-034-03 who usually supplied the hard cash , might
g01-034-04 be bold enough to demand the production of
g01-034-05 accounts , and even at times the impeachment of
g01-034-06 the unsuccessful . But the Commons were not
g01-034-07 the people , and even a full Parliament was
g01-034-08 not yet a true mirror of the nation .
g01-037-00 The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's
g01-037-01 ' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the
g01-037-02 feudal obligations of work or villeins who
g01-037-03 had bought their release , free labourers
g01-037-04 who worked for the highest bidders , free
g01-037-05 yeomen who had prospered enough to become
g01-037-06 successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen ,
g01-037-07 journeymen and small tradesmen of the
g01-037-08 towns , and the retainers and men-at-arms
g01-037-09 in the pay of landed Lords .
g02-073-00 ' And while the heart is slowly dying ,
g02-073-01 one can sometimes see it - so to speak
g02-073-02 - rouse itself and , in reply to two or
g02-073-03 three auricular beats , produce a single
g02-073-04 ventricular one slowly and
g02-073-05 reluctantly and with an effort . '
g03-000-01 Yet in spite of the fact that his ideas did his
g03-000-02 business no good George would never conceal them .
g03-000-03 He was a socialist and believed in the right
g03-000-04 of the working class to control their own destiny , and
g03-000-05 said so . Being a craftsman and a skilled man ,
g03-000-06 George won many prizes , and though some people
g03-000-07 would have nothing to do with him , others
g03-000-08 would , and the comrades helped in many
g03-052-00 There was no abatement in political
g03-052-01 work . The British Socialist Party endea-
g03-052-02 voured to get more socialist members sent to the
g03-052-03 Council , and to Parliament , being deter-
g03-052-04 mined and obdurate in their attitude that
g03-052-05 their candidate must go forward in the
g03-052-06 elections . In the Sheffield Trades and Labour
g03-052-07 Council meeting on October 16 , 1912 , George
g03-052-08 had said , ' Mr. Barton would go to the poll .
g03-052-09 Just as the Labour Party had fought the
g03-052-10 Liberals , they were going to fight the Labour
g03-064-00 Alf Barton , who in 1911 was presented
g03-064-01 with a book on the life of Marx ,
g03-064-02 and a gold purse in recognition of his
g03-064-03 work for the movement , was later
g03-064-04 known to say that it was not ne-
g03-064-05 cessary to understand Marxism in order to
g03-064-06 understand socialism , though at this time
g03-064-07 he was a keen member of the B.S.P. .
g04-022-00 After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit
g04-022-01 Germany for ten years , by which time in
g04-022-02 1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
g04-022-03 Towards the end of my five and a half years'
g04-022-04 incumbency I was asked if I would start
g04-022-05 a village choral society and conduct it .
g04-022-06 This opened up a new interest , and we plunged
g04-043-00 But what a change from the dear little old church
g04-043-01 at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
g04-043-02 at Purley . One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the
g04-043-03 church was , it had its own atmosphere , and for centuries
g04-043-04 had been a House of Prayer . I could not but feel the
g04-043-05 chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is .
g04-043-06 When we had found a group of people who gladly
g04-043-07 co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place
g04-048-00 I suggested to the congregation that it needed
g04-048-01 warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we
g04-048-02 found many to help . Gifts of candlesticks and
g04-048-03 stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
g04-048-04 helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
g04-048-05 for prayer and quiet . In time we received similar
g04-048-06 gifts for the High Altar , and large East and West
m01-084-00 Deadly stillness , deadly portent !
m01-084-01 Steve awakened early and switched on
m01-084-02 the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO.
m01-084-03 The set lighted-up but gave only a low
m01-084-04 buzzing sound . He had just finished
m01-084-05 shaving when it came on , with a flat
m01-084-06 voice repeating : " This is BBC calling
m01-084-07 ... this is BBC calling ... "
m01-095-00 Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
m01-095-01 Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A
m01-095-02 flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
m01-095-03 the War Memorial . There was a deep
m01-095-04 whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing
m01-095-05 overtone that sang in his ears with an
m01-095-06 almost painful sharpness . He reversed and
m01-095-07 turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
m01-136-00 His whole attitude was a mixture of
m01-136-01 impatience pending an awaited
m01-136-02 communication and of a vague
m01-136-03 perplexity respecting his surroundings
m01-136-04 and the purpose he was to serve .
m01-136-05 Finally , being so obviously on their own ,
m01-136-06 Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
m01-136-07 at home . Steve switched on Dan's
m01-136-08 powerful , world-wide radio and systematically
m01-136-09 turned the tuning knob through all the
m01-136-10 tuning points of the world's great radio
m02-048-00 Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
m02-048-01 real days and would return to New York in late
m02-048-02 January or early February . Angelina might be a
m02-048-03 little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
m02-048-04 as arranged , but he consoled himself by
m02-048-05 thinking that he and Angelina would have
m02-048-06 plenty of time together in the future . And
m02-048-07 Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be
m02-048-08 back on Moon again , and able to do
m02-048-09 research at first hand into matters on which
m02-048-10 the future of everyone , including Angelina , depended ...
m02-059-00 Sometimes she took Harry around with her , but
m02-059-01 never her husband , a fact he accepted as inevitable . " I guess
m02-059-02 Sally made a mistake about me , " he said one
m02-059-03 evening , when he had been left to cook his own meal .
m02-059-04 All Sally's relations were 4makrodeb now , but Tom
m02-059-05 was a Static Mib , the middle-income-bracket equivalent
m02-066-00 All Aristotle was excited at the time , not by the prospect of the
m02-066-01 U.S. President's visit , but by a great storm in the photo-
m02-066-02 sphere of the sun . A matter which on Earth would hardly
m02-066-03 penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
m02-066-04 interest to the Mos , doubtless because their habitat is
m02-066-05 not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere .
m02-080-01 That 's how he got the votes , that 's how
m02-080-02 we came through to 4makrodeb status and
m02-080-03 got all these lovely things " - she waved a
m02-080-04 plump hand towards her grand pianos , etc :
m02-080-05 at the same time a door banged - " but don't
m02-080-06 say a word about it , Lester wants his
m02-080-07 mouth-organ to be forgotten now . The time
m02-080-08 has come for him to be taken seriously
m03-006-00 ' Something 's up , ' said Lord Undertone ,
m03-006-01 carefully casual . ' The servants are all on
m03-006-02 edge ... did you notice ? And the mules
m03-006-03 didn't seem to want to get off the raft . '
m03-006-04 He peered as it were into the dark secrets
m03-006-05 of the jungle . ' Think there 's Indians
m03-006-06 about ? ' It was most certainly an eerie
m03-006-07 night , exceptionally brilliant and strange ,
m03-006-08 for in the proximity of the mountains ,
m03-006-09 whose presence I could almost smell ,
m03-013-00 ' Impressive , ' Lord Undertone said , gazing reverently
m03-013-01 on the cosmic handiwork . ' All those stars . But I 'm
m03-013-02 a bit earthbound tonight , Trout . I 've got a queer
m03-013-03 feeling , like I always get when something
m03-013-04 sensational 's going to happen . There 's things lurking
m03-013-05 if you ask me . Might be jaguar , might be ...
m03-033-00 ' Bottle-Foot , my lord . ' ' Bottle-Foot ? ' His lordship
m03-033-01 may have thought I had become unbalanced
m03-033-02 through fear . ' A character Mr Gilberto mentioned
m03-033-03 to other day , my lord . A being of whom
m03-033-04 the forest Indians are said to be mortally
m03-033-05 afraid , with a hoof shaped like the heel
m03-033-06 of a bottle . If your lordship will excuse me
m03-110-00 Sally and of course Mrs Septimus , for surely
m03-110-01 Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
m03-110-02 myself ? But was it so ? I allowed myself
m03-110-03 to entertain for an instant the idea , the
m03-110-04 strange , the unwelcome , the almost
m03-110-05 inconceivable idea , that Ariadne's arrival
m03-110-06 would be inopportune ; and with the idea came
m03-110-07 a somewhat vulgar impulse , which I refused ,
m03-110-08 to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs
m03-110-09 Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
m03-114-00 But all three were to the casual
m03-114-01 observation I permitted myself unruffled ;
m03-114-02 Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
m03-114-03 thoughtful , but that was his habit . Indeed
m03-114-04 we were all invaded by a most tranquil
m03-114-05 mood . Even the Indian servants relaxed , knowing ,
m03-114-06 so Mr Gilberto told us , that the wild and
m03-114-07 savage tribes never approached this region : at
m03-114-08 any rate they remained with us , perhaps
m03-114-09 for such protection as our presence , or Mrs
m03-118-00 But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
m03-118-01 far from our minds that at any moment we were
m03-118-02 to receive a summons . I could see that Mr Septimus
m03-118-03 was impatient for it . This afternoon , then , we climbed
m03-118-04 a promontory , a mass of clean rock crowned with
m03-118-05 trees and bushes , that stood well out over the lake .
m04-107-00 " But Eth and me wanted to be
m04-107-01 at the Youth Hostel before dark . "
m04-107-02 Morfydd Owen was silent . But she
m04-107-03 looked down at the fast-disappearing
m04-107-04 earth , and it seemed to her that she
m04-107-05 would never see her Dai again . And
m04-107-06 though half an hour ago she had
m04-107-07 regarded this possibility with
m04-107-08 fortitude , it now filled her with
m04-107-09 dismay . Quietly she began to
m04-113-00 Dai , meanwhile , was pedalling
m04-113-01 furiously on the road . Not a sign of
m04-113-02 the bus . He passed The Traveller's
m04-113-03 Joy . At last he caught up Mr. Roberts ,
m04-113-04 walking very dogged towards Llangrwl .
m04-113-05 " Afternoon , Mr. Roberts , " he called , polite ,
m04-113-06 as he shot past . His spirits were rising .
m04-113-07 He had seen no sign of an accident .
m04-113-08 Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken .
m04-113-09 He would find the bus safe and sound in
m04-113-10 Llangrwl , and his dear Morfydd quietly
m04-123-00 But disappointment awaited him . A
m04-123-01 restive queue of people in the bus station ,
m04-123-02 waiting to be transported to Dinas . And
m04-123-03 when he went to Morfydd's house , all
m04-123-04 he found was Morfydd's mam , working
m04-123-05 herself up proper ... Getting dark , now .
m04-123-06 The conductor switched on the lights .
m04-123-07 The beleaguered passengers peered out of
m04-123-08 the windows . Little to be seen , only a
m04-123-09 few lone stars , and the distant earth
m04-123-10 brooding in her shroud of mist .
m04-131-00 Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped , nursing
m04-131-01 the sleeping Cadwallader . Driver and
m04-131-02 conductor peered ahead into nothingness .
m04-131-03 On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced
m04-131-04 his Eth . Morfydd thought of Dai . The
m04-131-05 Rev. Edwards , standing at the front ,
m04-131-06 looked at his forlorn flock . " What
m04-131-07 about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda ? "
m04-131-08 he suggested hopefully .
m04-138-00 They looked at him , sullen . His heart
m04-138-01 sank . If the Welsh found the situation
m04-138-02 too desperate for singing , then the
m04-138-03 situation , he realised , must be desperate
m04-138-04 indeed . But suddenly they were roused
m04-138-05 from their lethargy . Something was
m04-138-06 approaching , faster , faster , a tearing
m04-138-07 hurrying blur that was past and gone
m04-138-08 in a moment , followed by a great
m04-138-09 rush of sound . They waved frantically .
n01-000-00 Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had
n01-000-01 been inclined to regard women as something
n01-000-02 which must necessarily be subordinated to his
n01-000-03 career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
n01-000-04 his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl
n01-000-05 whom he had never met and on whom after no more
n01-000-06 than a couple of telephone calls he was
n01-000-07 prepared to place complete reliance .
n01-009-00 " Good luck , Air Marshal , " she said gently . " I 'll
n01-009-01 be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
n01-009-02 evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
n01-009-03 both at midnight . " They might have been
n01-009-04 arranging a supper party . Then she rang off .
n01-009-05 Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
n01-009-06 uneventful life had he come across a girl who
n01-009-07 sounded so charming and appeared to be so
n01-020-00 For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
n01-020-01 to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
n01-020-02 physical features were distinguishable solely by
n01-020-03 gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow-
n01-020-04 capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles
n01-020-05 below , was not recognisable among the host
n01-020-06 of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air
n01-020-07 radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots
n01-020-08 flickered across its surface , but there was
n01-031-00 In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
n01-031-01 make a direct comparison between the radar
n01-031-02 image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the
n01-031-03 Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the
n01-031-04 left , Milan . The directional angle of the
n01-031-05 scanner could be adjusted to cover any
n01-031-06 particular area within its range . Geoffrey
n01-031-07 turned the scale slowly to cover the
n01-031-08 ground immediately ahead .
n01-045-00 Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the
n01-045-01 pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
n01-045-02 dipped slightly . The needle of the speed
n01-045-03 recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0
n01-045-04 before coming to rest at 5.0 . " We 're a bit
n01-045-05 ahead of time , " said Alastair . " We 'll run
n01-045-06 in on minimum engine power . " Geoffrey
n01-045-07 smiled . Alastair talked of running in when
n01-045-08 they were still more than four hundred
n01-045-09 miles from their destination .
n02-004-00 To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a
n02-004-01 vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
n02-004-02 reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
n02-004-03 But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
n02-004-04 was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
n02-004-05 He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his
n02-004-06 own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of
n02-004-07 asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
n02-004-08 to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
n02-009-00 " I caught him just as he was going to the
n02-009-01 airport to meet Blanche , " he said . " As a matter
n02-009-02 of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise
n02-009-03 for me and fetch her . He brought her to the party
n02-009-04 too . They 're both here . " " I didn't know she was
n02-009-05 coming back from Barbados so soon . " Beryl
n02-009-06 said the first thing that came into her head .
n02-033-00 It was all over and done with .
n02-033-01 For the time being Beryl was content to let
n02-033-02 it go at that , but she resolved to have
n02-033-03 it out with Piers when a reasonable
n02-033-04 opportunity presented itself . He must
n02-033-05 learn that he could not treat her
n02-033-06 with injustice and contempt , ignoring
n02-033-07 her explanations as though he were
n02-033-08 a schoolmaster and she a small ,
n02-037-00 He gave her no chance of any private
n02-037-01 conversation that evening , for when
n02-037-02 Blanche and Jack left , he went with
n02-037-03 them . But next morning she insisted
n02-037-04 on his taking her out in the jeep -
n02-037-05 to find , if possible , Hubert and his
n02-037-06 relations , and tell them of
n02-037-07 her great disappointment at being
n02-037-08 held up in Balicou .
n02-154-00 And then she received a jolt . Old Hubert , standing
n02-154-01 beside her , his battered hat in his hand , his
n02-154-02 toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her
n02-154-03 in halting 6patois that " 3Mistah Piers " had
n02-154-04 explained right at the start that " 3Mis' Beryl "
n02-154-05 would be 3" plenty , plenty sad " not to be back
n02-157-00 That it wouldn't be her fault at all . That
n02-157-01 she was a lady who , like her Uncle Charles ,
n02-157-02 took the highest pride in keeping her word . " I
n02-157-03 could see 3anudder 3t'ing , " he went on in a
n02-157-04 lower voice , his sunken black eyes twinkling .
n02-157-05 3" He powerful anxious , poor Mistah Piers .
n02-157-06 We all know how Balicou Island dangerous
n02-157-07 to all kin' o' boats , wid d'ose big , big
n02-157-08 rocks in an' out o' de water .
n03-106-00 " Willie , " the judge said huskily ,
n03-106-01 " that was as pretty a piece of seamans-
n03-106-02 hip as I ever saw . That boy of
n03-106-03 mine seems to know how to do
n03-106-04 everything , when he wants to . "
n03-106-05 " 3Naw , " disputed Willie . 3" Just
n03-106-06 play in damn fine luck this time .
n03-106-07 He plenty smart though . " As they
n03-106-08 reached the pier , the judge on legs
n03-106-09 that were a little unsteady , they
n03-106-10 found Bueno Buck , now on the
n03-106-11 pier , leading the yawl toward
n03-113-00 " Hello , Dad ! " Bill called . " I hope you
n03-113-01 weren't worried . We 're going to
n03-113-02 drag the boat ashore and turn
n03-113-03 her over . She has a foot of
n03-113-04 water in her . I wouldn't be
n03-113-05 surprised if we broke all
n03-113-06 speed records on the way in .
n03-113-07 Yes sir , I am slightly wet , and
n03-113-08 Buck would be wetter if he
n03-113-09 had more clothes on . "
n04-130-00 John flushed . " I 'm not in need of charity . " " Come
n04-130-01 off it , " said Bawley . " The proprietor of the Daily
n04-130-02 Courier knows what 's going on . If he doesn't mind ,
n04-130-03 why should you ? " " I see . " John took the
n04-130-04 refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
n04-130-05 companion . " You want me to talk , is that it ? "
n04-139-00 " You misjudge me , " said Bawley . " You have
n04-139-01 nothing to tell me , yet . But we 'll be meeting
n04-139-02 again , no doubt , and then you will have .
n04-139-03 Regard this as a softening-up process , and
n04-139-04 have dinner with me ? On His Lordship ,
n04-139-05 of course . " " On one condition , " said John .
n04-139-06 " Tell me who the little bird was . " " Can't
n04-139-07 you guess ? Whose portrait appears regularly
n04-149-00 " You mean Munyard ? " " Sure . Very useful
n04-149-01 contact , is our Robbie ; he gives us the gen and
n04-149-02 we give him the publicity . ' The Honourable
n04-149-03 " Robbie " and friend ' , what ? You know the
n04-149-04 sort of thing . " " You 'll get nothing out of me , "
n04-149-05 said John , " but you can pay for my drinks
n04-149-06 if you want to , as long as you keep off
n04-156-00 " Good-oh ! One for the grill-room , darling , and
n04-156-01 tell George to bring in the 6carte du jour . "
n04-156-02 Bawley was a man of his word . He kept
n04-156-03 away from Service matters , was an excellent
n04-156-04 host and a splendid raconteur . The evening
n04-156-05 passed all too quickly . As they parted in
n04-156-06 the vestibule the two men were well
n04-156-07 disposed towards each other .
n04-163-00 " Ever been to Fleet Street ? " asked Bawley .
n04-163-01 " You should . Next time you 're in Town
n04-163-02 give me a ring at this number and I 'll
n04-163-03 take you round the pubs where most
n04-163-04 of the work is done . " He held out a card .
n04-163-05 John took it and put it in his pocket .
n04-163-06 " Thanks , " he said . " If ever my missus
n04-163-07 lets me off the chain I 'll take you
n04-202-00 Glad I met you . Don't forget to give me a ring -
n04-202-01 any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley , what ? "
n04-202-02 " I don't know when that will be , " said John .
n04-202-03 " I shall be busy for a while , cleaning up after
n04-202-04 Master bloody Munyard . " THERE were six submarines ,
n04-202-05 lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse .
n04-202-06 Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
n04-202-07 sounded , for all of them were rumbling as they
n04-202-08 charged their electric batteries .
n04-209-00 A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
n04-209-01 through the open windows of the Captain's house . It
n04-209-02 pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
n04-209-03 Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
n04-209-04 a substantial breakfast . Although usually a very
n04-209-05 talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
n04-209-06 silences , for she knew they betokened a worry of
n04-213-00 There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
n04-213-01 affair of Parsifal . Harry had lost a good deal of weight .
n04-213-02 His normal placid and steady-going manner remained ,
n04-213-03 but she could see that it no longer came naturally .
n04-213-04 It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
n04-213-05 to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine ,
n04-213-06 though in peace time these happenings are few and
n04-218-00 This is the testing time for all . The affair blows up into
n04-218-01 a national disaster and then when it is all over life
n04-218-02 must continue as before . During this period the Captain
n04-218-03 must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
n04-218-04 if nothing unusual has happened . Harry Turton had
n04-218-05 written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the
n04-218-06 locality , had been interviewed by the Press , had driven
n04-218-07 his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
n04-218-08 usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
n06-074-00 He rode down to where I was waiting . I was
n06-074-01 thinking what a skill he had for reading
n06-074-02 my mind . " This would be as good a place
n06-074-03 for a hold-up as any , " he said , reining in
n06-074-04 near me . " Yes , " I said . " It 'll be here to-
n06-074-05 morrow as likely as not . " I paused . " Miss
n06-074-06 Jeannie 'll be on that coach , Dan . "
n06-082-00 " Yes , " he said . " I know . " " No harm must come
n06-082-01 to her , Dan . " " She 'll be all right . It 's the
n06-082-02 men who 'll be after that coach I 'm interested
n06-082-03 in , Johnny . " " I know . But if lead starts
n06-082-04 flying she might be in danger . " " That 's so .
n06-082-05 But I reckon they 'll be too busy shooting at
n06-082-06 us to bother with the coach and the folks
n06-092-00 " Maybe , " I said . " But we 've got to remember
n06-092-01 that girl all the time , Dan . I feel kind
n06-092-02 of responsible for her . " " Of course , " he said ,
n06-092-03 giving me one of his strange looks . Then he
n06-092-04 turned the conversation . " Let 's ride over
n06-092-05 and have a look at the mining camp .
n06-092-06 After all it 's them we 're supposed to be
n06-092-07 working for , as well as the townsfolk and
n06-100-00 With something of a start I remembered the
n06-100-01 man who 'd brought us into this business .
n06-100-02 " Maybe you don't know about Appleton ,
n06-100-03 Dan ? " " Know what ? " " That he 's dead , "
n06-100-04 I said . I watched him because I was always
n06-100-05 fascinated by the way he looked when you
n06-100-06 tried to surprise him . " Dead ? " he said . " Yes .
n06-100-07 Dead . Shuffled out of the deck . Blasted
n06-100-08 down with a shotgun outside the Palace
n06-111-00 " Fenton or Somers , " he said . " Or the Town
n06-111-01 Marshal , " I added . His face was fixed ,
n06-111-02 unreadable as a rock . " Let 's get over to the
n06-111-03 mining camp , " he said abruptly . He wheeled
n06-111-04 his horse back off the trail and up the slope
n06-111-05 leading to the ridge . I followed . From the
n06-111-06 top you could see something of the wild hill
n06-111-07 country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing .
n06-119-00 The air was fresh and clear and you
n06-119-01 could see far over west and north for many
n06-119-02 miles . The real high country of the Rockies
n06-119-03 lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
n06-119-04 colour drawing . Between us and that lay
n06-119-05 a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and
n06-123-00 " The mine-workings lie north of the town , "
n06-123-01 said Dan . " If we head west we ought to
n06-123-02 cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north . "
n06-123-03 So we swung west , making slow going over
n06-123-04 rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down
n06-123-05 into draws , circling a big mesa by a
n06-123-06 four or five mile valley , sandy-floored . It
n06-123-07 got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
n06-123-08 gratefully by a small creek where we watered
n06-123-09 the horses and drank enough to cure our
n06-128-00 An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
n06-128-01 we figured would lead to the miners' camp .
n06-128-02 We turned north into it and after about four
n06-128-03 miles it led into a small canyon which
n06-128-04 opened out into a wide shallow draw .
n06-128-05 Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
n06-128-06 the miners at work . They were scattered
n06-128-07 over a fairly wide area working singly or
n06-133-00 We didn't approach unchallenged . Just short
n06-133-01 of the diggings there was a roughly-built
n06-133-02 shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
n06-133-03 out , " If you come any closer , I 'll sure blow
n06-133-04 your whiskers off . " " Take it easy , mister , " I sang
n06-133-05 out . " We don't aim to come any closer and we 've
n06-133-06 got no whiskers so as you can see . Just you
n06-133-07 go and tell Nick Dowd we 've come to talk
n06-133-08 to him about what happened last night . "
n06-140-00 " Oh , " said the unseen guard . He blew a
n06-140-01 whistle then , loud and shrill . The gun barrel
n06-140-02 peeking out through a hole in the shack never
n06-140-03 wavered . We sat our horses , waiting . " Looks as
n06-140-04 though they 're expecting trouble , " I said . " Where
n06-140-05 there 's gold and women there 's always trouble , "
n06-140-06 observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle . He
p01-155-00 Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
p01-155-01 outbuilding , but this was happening to him now . He
p01-155-02 saw himself as a sulky , ugly , malformed , repressed
p01-155-03 boy , then a young youth . He saw himself refusing
p01-155-04 baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to .
p01-155-05 Walking out of the chapel later on . Continuing
p01-155-06 on , his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
p01-155-07 canery and corruption , the growth of the dea-
p01-155-08 dly decadence and absorption in debase-
p01-155-09 ment and Satanic debauchery .
p01-174-00 " Yes . I travelled down from London
p01-174-01 as the dawn was breaking , and
p01-174-02 the thought came to me I 'd like
p01-174-03 to take a look at the church . I 've
p01-174-04 never been inside . Very remiss of
p01-174-05 me , " said Mr. Copthorne . The verger
p01-174-06 led the way in . " The stained glass
p01-174-07 windows , sir , they date back to
p01-174-08 the fourteenth century . "
p02-076-00 Gay thanked him and walked out on to
p02-076-01 the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
p02-076-02 had bought a drink and taken it outside .
p02-076-03 She looked round scanning the tables ,
p02-076-04 then caught her breath , a cold hand
p02-076-05 seeming to clutch her heart . Gavin was
p02-076-06 seated at a small table in a shadowy
p02-076-07 corner talking animatedly to Simone .
p02-076-08 As Gay watched he offered the girl a
p02-076-09 cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping
p02-076-10 hers in an intimate way .
p02-081-00 Gay stood irresolute for a moment , half
p02-081-01 decided to go back and join Lilyan and
p02-081-02 Doc , while she wanted to do no more than
p02-081-03 run upstairs to her room , knowing that
p02-081-04 Gavin although he had told her that he
p02-081-05 loved her , was already flirting with a girl
p02-081-06 that he had only met a few minutes before .
p02-081-07 Larry's advice flashed through her mind ,
p02-081-08 but she turned away , giving a little
p02-081-09 gesture of hopelessness , knowing that her
p02-115-00 Doc gave her hand a shake . " Wake up
p02-115-01 Gay , and don't even contemplate throwing
p02-115-02 yourself away on a chap like that . You 're a
p02-115-03 fine girl , intelligent , and pretty , and I had
p02-115-04 thought you were sensible too . Don't
p02-115-05 make a fool of yourself over someone
p02-115-06 who doesn't care two jots for your feelings .
p02-115-07 If he behaves like this now what is your
p02-115-08 married life going to be like ?
p03-072-00 " 5Ye-es ? " he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
p03-072-01 mouth , an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge .
p03-072-02 " What about it , my sweet ? " " Well , " she laughed
p03-072-03 suddenly in an upsurging of relief , " that stupid
p03-072-04 Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble .
p03-072-05 With a blonde , too . Imagine ! " Nigel was frowning . He
p03-072-06 looked distinguished when he frowned ; boyishly
p03-181-00 " If I were somebody else's girl that 's
p03-181-01 what you 'd get , " she flashed at him , and
p03-181-02 so had left him , on her dignity and not
p03-181-03 seeing the look of admiration and revelation
p03-181-04 which had followed her slim young figure
p03-181-05 out of his sight . " Mine , " Nigel Lester had
p03-181-06 decided with a sigh of satisfaction , and
p03-181-07 then regarded the ring which he retrieved
p03-181-08 from his pocket . " At a price , " he concluded ,
p03-181-09 with some bitterness .

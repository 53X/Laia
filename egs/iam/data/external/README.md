Unfortunately, the LOB, Brown and Wellington corpora have a restrictive
copyright that forbids us from publishing the required files here.

There is a version of these datasets circulating among different research
groups. If you have access to these files, place the `brown.txt`,
`lob_excludealltestsets.txt` and `wellington.txt` files in this directory.

Otherwise, you will not be able to use external data to build the n-gram
language models.
